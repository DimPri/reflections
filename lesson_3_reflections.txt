When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i want to access the files remotely or collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do that when i don't want to share all my project's changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks exist only in context of GitHub, clones are repositories in local computer and branches exist in both GitHub and local.
